So this is a demo of a video game I'm making for my sister's birthday and here the source code. 
It was my first time coding in Haxe so it was kinda hard and it took me 14 days.
This demo is available to play on Itch.io at https://therealmadodev.itch.io/giuss-maze. (consider fave-ing it) 
Thank you for visiting this! It's also my first time putting my source code on here.
